# From Agent Starter Pack

`agents-cli` is the successor to Agent Starter Pack (ASP). It builds on the same foundation with key improvements.

---

## What Changed

**Coding agent first.** ASP was built for humans running an interactive CLI. agents-cli is built for coding agents — with 7 bundled skills that give them deep context about ADK, evaluation, deployment, and observability. Every command still works from the terminal too.

**CLI replaces Makefile.** ASP used `make` targets (`make dev`, `make eval`, `make deploy`). agents-cli replaces them with a unified CLI covering the full lifecycle, with flags, help text, and structured output.

**New capabilities.** agents-cli adds commands that didn't exist in ASP: `playground`, `run`, `deploy`, `eval run`, `eval compare`, `lint`, `login`, and skill management (`setup`, `update`).

### Command Mapping

| Agent Starter Pack | agents-cli |
|---|---|
| `create` | `create` (alias for `scaffold create`) |
| `enhance` | `scaffold enhance` |
| `upgrade` | `scaffold upgrade` |
| `setup-cicd` | `infra cicd` |
| `register-gemini-enterprise` | `publish gemini-enterprise` |

### Config Key

The `pyproject.toml` section changed from `[tool.agent-starter-pack]` to `[tool.agents-cli]`:

```toml
# Before
[tool.agent-starter-pack]
agent_directory = "app"

[tool.agent-starter-pack.create_params]
deployment_target = "cloud_run"

# After
[tool.agents-cli]
agent_directory = "app"

[tool.agents-cli.create_params]
deployment_target = "cloud_run"
```

### Template Coverage

agents-cli currently supports `adk`, `adk_a2a`, and `agentic_rag` (Python). ASP had additional templates (`adk_go`, `adk_java`, `adk_ts`, `adk_live`, `custom_a2a`) that are not yet available in agents-cli. Support for these is planned.

### What Stays the Same

- **Templates** — same agent templates (`adk`, `adk_a2a`, `agentic_rag`), same deployment targets, same session storage options
- **Project structure** — generated projects have the same layout, your `app/agent.py` code is unchanged
- **Terraform** — same infrastructure-as-code under `deployment/terraform/`
- **CI/CD pipelines** — same Cloud Build and GitHub Actions configurations

## Migrating an Existing Project

Your existing ASP projects are fully compatible. The only required change is renaming the config section in `pyproject.toml`.

**Step 1: Install agents-cli**

```bash
uvx google-agents-cli setup
```

**Step 2: Rename the config section**

```bash
sed -i '' 's/tool.agent-starter-pack/tool.agents-cli/g' pyproject.toml
```

**Step 3: Verify**

```bash
agents-cli info
```

This shows your project config and confirms agents-cli can read it. Your agent code, tests, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines all work as before.
